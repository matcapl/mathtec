**Key Metrics**: 10,000 → 120 implementations (1.2% conversion), 24-hour time-to-insight
**Critical KPIs**: 250+ data sources, 87% accuracy, 4.2x ROI on intelligence

### 5. Sales Funnel
**Pipeline**: MQLs → SQLs → Demos → Proposals → Negotiations → Contracts → Closed Won
**Key Metrics**: 800 → 25 deals (3.1% conversion), 3.5 months sales cycle
**Critical KPIs**: $150K average deal value, 25% win rate, $500K customer LTV

### 6. Operational Improvements Funnel
**Pipeline**: Opportunity ID → Assessment → Feasibility → Planning → Pilot → Rollout → Validation
**Key Metrics**: 200 → 15 validations (7.5% conversion), 4.5 months time-to-value
**Critical KPIs**: $2.5M average savings, 75% implementation success, 6.8x ROI
